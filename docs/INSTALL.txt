Windows
-------
  Compiling
  ---------
    Tux Paint Config. comes pre-compiled for Windows, so no compilation
    is necessary.
    
    As of February 2005 (starting with Tux Paint Config v.0.0.6), the Makefile
    included support for building on a Windows system using MinGW/MSYS.

    After building and installing all the dependencies, use these commands,
    in MSYS, to build, install and run:

      export set CPATH=/usr/local/include
      export set LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/lib
      make win32
      make install-win32
      tuxpaint-config

  Installing

<h1>About</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Config." is a graphical configuration tool for
  "Tux&nbsp;Paint."  It provides a point-and-click interface that allows
  parents and teachers to alter Tux&nbsp;Paint's behavior -- disable sound
  effects, run in full-screen mode, etc. &mdash; without needing to manipulate
  a text-based configuration file.</p>

<h1>Using Tux Paint Config.</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Config.'s interface is divided into seven (7) tabs,
  each containing a different category of options that you can change in
  Tux&nbsp;Paint.  (For full details on Tux&nbsp;Paint's options, we
  recommend reading Tux&nbsp;Paint's own documentation.)</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the screen are three buttons:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>Defaults</b> - This sets the options shown on the current tab to
    their default settings.  (In other words, how Tux&nbsp;Paint would operate
    if you didn't make any changes to the options.)</li>

  <li><b>Apply</b> - This saves settings of all the options, on all the
    tabs, to your Tux&nbsp;Paint configuration file.  (On Linux and Unix,
    this is "<code>~/.tuxpaintrc</code>".  On Windows, this is
    "<code>tuxpaint.cfg</code>".  On Mac OS X, it is "<code>
    ~/Library/Application Support/TuxPaint/tuxpaint.cfg</code>".)</li>

  <li><b>Reset</b> - This discards all unsaved changes on all the tabs.
    It loads whatever settings are currently stored in your Tux&nbsp;Paint
    configuration file.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Also at the bottom are two additional options:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>Settings for:</b> - This lets you change which configuration file
  Tux&nbsp;Paitn&nbsp;Config. tries to save to when you click "Apply":
  either the <b>Current&nbsp;User</b>'s, or
  <b>All&nbsp;Users</b>' (the system-wide config. file).</li>

  <li><b>Use "All Users" Settings</b> - Checking this option causes all
  configuration options in Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Config. to be greyed out.
  When you click "Apply", the current user's config. file will be deleted,
  causing them to use <i>only</i> the system-wide ("All&nbsp;users")
  config. file!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The various tabs, and the options found within, are described below:</p>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This tab simply contains some information about
    Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Config.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Video &amp; Sound</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Fullscreen</b> - This causes Tux&nbsp;Paint to (attempt to) run
      in fullscreen mode, rather than in a window on your desktop.  It causes
      Tux&nbsp;Paint to display across your entire screen (or as much as it
      can, with a border around the outside), in essense turning your monitor
      into a Tux&nbsp;Paint-only display.

      <ul>
      <li><b>Native</b> - This causes Tux&nbsp;Paint to run using your
        current desktop resolution when you run in fullscreen mode.
        Example: If you have Tux&nbsp;Paint set to run in a 800x600 window
        on your 1280x800 laptop, but you have this option enabled, it
        will run at 1280x800 when you launch Tux&nbsp;Paint in fullscreen
        mode (rather than dropping your laptop's LCD display down to 800x600,
        which might not look right).</li>
      </ul>

    <li><b>Window Size</b> - By default, Tux&nbsp;Paint creates
      a relatively small window (800&nbsp;pixels across by 600&nbsp;pixels
      high).  Since many people prefer a larger drawing canvas, or have
      screens at different aspect ratios or larger sizes, Tux&nbsp;Paint
      can be told to create a larger window, instead.  If running in
      fullscreen, this also determines the monitor resolution Tux&nbsp;Paint
      will try to switch into, unless the "Native" option is set.</li>

    <li><b>Rotate Orientation</b> - This option swaps the width and height
      values given in the "Window&nbsp;Size" setting, which can be useful
      for displays with portrait aspect ratios (e.g., a tablet PC in the
      tablet orientation, vs. the laptop orientation).</li>

    <li><b>Allow Screensaver</b> - By default, the underlying system that
      Tux&nbsp;Paint uses for graphics disables your screensaver.  You can
      set this option to allow your screensaver to appear, even while
      Tux&nbsp;Paint is running.</li>

    <li><b>Enable Sound Effects</b> - By default, Tux&nbsp;Paint plays
      sounds for practically every action that takes place... drawing with
      the brush, displaying a pop-up dialog, painting a rainbow.  By
      un-checking this option, you can turn sounds off.</li>

    <li><b>Use Alternative Color Palette</b> - This allows you to specify
      a file containing colors that Tux&nbsp;Paint should provide to the
      user.  (See Tux&nbsp;Paint's documentation for details on the
      format.)</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Mouse &amp; Keyboard</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Fancy Cursor Shapes</b> - Normally, Tux&nbsp;Paint changes the
      shape of your mouse pointer when the mouse is inside the Tux&nbsp;Paint
      window.  It turns into a large brush when painting, and a cross-hair
      when drawing lines, for example.  However, the large brushes can cause
      problems on some systems, so you can disable this option if the brushes
      don't work right for you.</li>

    <li><b>Hide Cursor</b> - Completely hides the mouse pointer in
      Tux&nbsp;Paint.  Useful when using a touchscreen (such as a tablet PC
      or handheld device), rather than a mouse or drawing tablet.</li>

    <li><b>Enable Keyboard Shortcuts</b> - Tux&nbsp;Paint supports some
      keyboard shortcuts ('accelerators'), like Control&nbsp;+&nbsp;S to Save
      and Control&nbsp;+&nbsp;Z to Undo.  If your child hits the keyboard
      accidentally, you can disable these shortcuts to prevent them from being
      used accidentally.</li>

    <li><b>Grab Mouse Pointer</b> - If you'd rather not run Tux&nbsp;Paint
      in fullscreen mode, but you want to keep children from getting at your
      desktop files or other applications, you can have Tux&nbsp;Paint 'grab'
      the mouse pointer, which prevents it from leaving the Tux&nbsp;Paint
      window.</li>

    <li><b>Mouse Wheel Support</b> - If your mouse has a scroll wheel,
      Tux&nbsp;Paint will let you use it to scroll up and down through the
      selection menu on the right (e.g., the brush or stamp collections).
      However, if your child still lacks dexterity with the mouse, they may
      hit the scroll wheel accidentally, and get frustrated.  You can tell
      Tux&nbsp;Paint to ignore the mouse wheel, if that is the case.</li>

    <li><b>No Button Distinction</b> - Tux Paint notices if the user is
      accidentally clicking with the middle or right button on a mouse,
      and after a number of clicks, pops up a window explaining which
      button should be used.  If this option is enabled, the pop-up does
      not appear, and the middle and right mouse button can be used
      (they act the same as the left button).</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Simplification</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If your child is very young, or is handicapped, the 'Simplification'
    options can help make Tux&nbsp;Paint even easier to use.</p>

    <ul>
    <li><b>Disable Shape Rotation</b> - Tux&nbsp;Paint's 'Shape' tool works
      in three steps: (1)&nbsp;click where you want the center of your shape
      to be, (2)&nbsp;drag out from the center to determine the size of the
      shape, and (3)&nbsp;move the mouse to rotate the shape, and click once
      more to finalize it.  The third step (rotation) can be tricky to get
      the hang of, and very young children are more interested in the shapes
      themselves, not the angles they can be drawn at.  Hence, you can
      disable shape rotation by selecting this option.</li>

    <li><b>Simple Stamp Outlines</b> - If your computer is very slow, or
      you're using Tux&nbsp;Paint on a thin client (displaying over a network),
      you can simplify the outlines drawn around stamps to help speed up the
      display.</li>

    <li><b>Show Uppercase Text Only</b> - If your child is just learning to
      read, and hasn't yet mastered the lowercase alphabet, you can tell
      Tux&nbsp;Paint to display everything in uppercase. (LIKE THIS.)</li>

    <li><b>Disable Quit Button</b> - This greys out the 'Quit' button in
      Tux&nbsp;Paint.  The Escape key and the close button in the window's
      toolbar still work (though the latter can be made inaccessible by
      running Tux&nbsp;Paint in fullscreen mode, or in mouse-grab mode.)</li>

    <li><b>Disable Stamps Tool</b> - This prevents Tux&nbsp;Paint from loading
      any stamps at start-up, this speeding up the load process and, of course,
      causing the 'Stamps' tool button to be greyed out.</li>

    <li><b>Disable Stamp Controls</b> - Tux&nbsp;Paint allows stamps to be
      shrunk and grown, and many stamps can be flipped and/or mirrored.
      These options add four buttons to the Stamp tool's selector, however,
      which can confuse the younger users.  Disable those controls with this
      option.</li>

    <li><b>Disable Magic Controls</b> - Some of Tux&nbsp;Paint's Magic tools
      work as a painting tool, some apply their effect to the entire canvas,
      and some can do both.  This option removes the button that selects
      which mode Magic tools run in.  (If this option is set, tools will
      default to painting mode, unless they do not support it.)</li>

    <li><b>Initial Stamp Size</b> - This lets you set a default size for
      all Stamps in Tux&nbsp;Paint. Normally, it picks a size based on the
      stamp's size, your canvas size, and/or settings provided specifically
      for the stamp.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Languages</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Language</b> - Tux&nbsp;Paint has been translated into dozens of
      languages.  While it can use your system's global language preference,
      you may prefer to run your desktop in one language, and have your
      children use Tux&nbsp;Paint in another.  Select the language you want
      Tux&nbsp;Paint to run in from the pull-down menu.  (Select "Use system's
      setting" to use your system's global language preference.)</li>

    <li><b>Mirror Stamps</b> - Some people are used to things going
      right-to-left, rather than left-to-right.  (Hebrew is written
      right-to-left, for example.)  Most stamps are oriented left-to-right,
      and many can be mirrored using the 'Mirror' stamp control.  You can
      tell Tux&nbsp;Paint to mirror <i>all</i> such stamps, by default,
      when it starts up.</li>

    <li><b>Load System Fonts</b> - This causes Tux&nbsp;Paint to look
      around typical locations on your hard drive for fonts, and adds ones
      that seem useful to the fonts available in the "Text" tool.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Printing</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Allow Printing</b> - If you wish to disable the 'Print' button
      in Tux&nbsp;Paint, un-check this option.</li>

    <li><b>Print Delay</b> - If you wish to allow printing in Tux&nbsp;Paint,
      but limit it to, say, only once every 5 minutes, you can enter a delay
      value (in seconds).  After printing, Tux&nbsp;Paint will wait that
      long before the 'Print' button works again.</li>

    <li><b>Show Printer Dialog</b> - Tux Paint can bring up a system
      printer dialog if the [Alt] key ([Option] on Macs) is held while the
      "Print" button is clicked.  These options allow you to disable this
      feature (never show a dialog), or to <i>always</i> show a dialog,
      even when [Alt] isn't being held.</li>

    <li><b>Use Alternative Print Command / Alternative Print Command</b> -
      <i>(Advanced! Unix/Linux only!)</i> By default, Tux&nbsp;Paint under
      Linux and Unix uses the external program '<code>lpr</code>' for printing
      pictures.  You can specify a different command here.
      The command you specify must accept PostScript format
      on it's standard input (STDIN).</li>

    <li><b>Use Alternative Print Dialog</b> -
      <i>(Advanced! Unix/Linux only!)</i> By default, Tux&nbsp;Paint under
      Linux and Unix uses the extnernal program '<code>kprinter</code>'
      (KDE, the K&nbsp;Desktop&nbsp;Environment's printer tool).
      You can specify a different command here.
      The command you specify must accept PostScript format
      on it's standard input (STDIN).</li>

    <li><b>Paper Size</b> - This lets you choose the size of paper that
      you're using with Tux&nbsp;Paint.  You can use your system's default,
      or override it with a specific paper size (e.g., "A4" or
      "US&nbsp;Letter").</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Saving</h2>
  <blockquote>
     <h3>Save Over Earlier Work</h3>
     <blockquote>
       <p>Tux&nbsp;Paint has one 'Save' command, which works with one click.
       If you're done drawing a picture, click 'Save' and it is saved, no
       questions asked!</p>

       <p><i>However</i>, if you're re-saving a picture that you loaded using
       the 'Open' command, Tux&nbsp;Paint needs to know whether you want to
       save over the original, or save a new image.  (In most other programs,
       this would be 'Save' versus 'Save&nbsp;As...', respectively.)</p>

       <p>By default, Tux&nbsp;Paint will pop up a prompt asking whether to
       'save over the older version of [the] picture.'  Choosing 'Yes' will
       wipe out the old version, replacing it with the updated drawing.
       Choosing 'No' will preserve the old version, and save a completely new
       file.</p>

       <p>To simplify the 'Save' process by never asking the 'save&nbsp;over?'
       question, you can tell Tux&nbsp;Paint what to do ahead of time:</p>

       <ul>
       <li><b>Ask Before Overwriting</b> - This is the default behavior,
         described above.  (Ask whether to save over, or not.)</li>

       <li><b>Always Overwrite Older Version</b> - This will always
         wipe out the old version, replacing it with any updates to the
         drawing.  (It's like 'Save' in other desktop applications.)</li>

       <li><b>Always Save New Picture</b> - This will never wipe out older
         work, this preserving every single change that's ever been saved.
         (It's like always using 'Save&nbsp;As...' in other desktop
         applications.)  <u>Warning:</u> Using this option obviously
         creates the potential for <i>many</i> files being stored in
         Tux&nbsp;Paint!  You may want to go in and manually remove
         files for your child.  (Tux&nbsp;Paint's 'Open' dialog uses
         thumbnails to show the saved pictures, and includes an 'Erase'
         button, so you can do this from within Tux&nbsp;Paint.)</li>
       </ul>
     </blockquote>

     <h3>Start Blank</h3>
     <blockquote>
       <p>This option tells Tux&nbsp;Paint to always start with a blank
       (white) drawing canvas, rather than re-loading the last-saved picture
       (its default behavior).</p>
     </blockquote>

     <h3>Save Directory</h3>
     <blockquote>
       <p>Since Tux&nbsp;Paint never asks where to save pictures (or what
       filename to use when creating the files), it keeps all of its pictures
       in its own special directory.</p>

       <p>If you wish to change where Tux&nbsp;Paint saves pictures
       (and, of course, where it looks for them when the 'Open' command is
       used), you can do so here.</p>

       <p>This can be useful in a school lab where all of the computers are
       shared by students, and students must log into a special network
       drive to save their files.  You can tell Tux&nbsp;Paint to save on the
       mapped network drive, rather than on the local hard drive.</p>

       <p>See Tux&nbsp;Paint's own documentation for more on the subject.</p>
     </blockquote>

     <h3>Disable 'Save' Button</h3>
     <blockquote>
       <p>If you wish for Tux&nbsp;Paint to be used only as a 'scratch&nbsp;pad'
       for drawing, you may disable the 'Save' button.  Obviously, this
       makes it impossible to save any drawings, so most people will have no
       use for this option.</p>
     </blockquote>

     <h3>Auto-save on Quit</h3>
     <blockquote>
       <p>This tells Tux&nbsp;Paint not to ask whether you wish to save
       the current picture (if unsaved) when you quit.  It will assume
       you always do.  (If it needs to ask about saving over an old copy,
       it will still do so.)</p>
     </blockquote>

  </blockquote>
  
  <h2>Data</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Don't use lockfile</b> - Normally, when Tux&nbsp;Paint is launched
      it creates a small data file called a 'lockfile.'  If this file exists,
      and Tux&nbsp;Paint is launched again, the second copy will quit
      immediately.  This was done to prevent multiple copies of Tux&nbsp;Paint
      from loading when children over-eagerly and/or impatiently click the
      launcher icon.  However, if you're using Tux&nbsp;Paint on a networked
      filesystem, and all users share the same folder, this may prevent more
      than one computer from running Tux&nbsp;Paint.  Enable this setting
      to ask Tux&nbsp;Paint to not use lockfiles, and ignore any that may
      be there.</li>

    <li><b>Use Alternative Data Directory</b> - Similar to
      "Use Alternative Save Directory," above, this option lets you
      specify a different location for Tux&nbsp;Paint to look for its
      data files: brushes, stamps, etc.  (This can be good if you have
      school-specific data for Tux&nbsp;Paint stored on a network drive
      that you'd like all your students to use, rather than Tux&nbsp;Paint's
      default data files, located on the local hard disk.)</li>
    </ul>
